Hi I am David and I am in the thick of it

		<p>Thick of it Lyrics

<p>I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
<p> They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
<p> I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
<p> Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
<p> I'm in my prime and this ain't even final form
<p> They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor
<p> I went from living rooms straight out to sold-out tours
<p> Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war
Woah-oh-oh
<p> This is how the story goes
<p> Woah-oh-oh
<p> I guess this is how the story goes
<p> I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
<p> They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
<p> I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
<p> Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
<p> From the screen to the ring, to the pen, to the king
<p> Where's my crown? That's my bling
<p> Always drama when I ring
<p> See, I believe that if I see it in my heart
<p> Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reachin' for the stars
<p> Woah-oh-oh
<p> This is how the story goes
<p> Woah-oh-oh
<p> I guess this is how the story goes
<p> I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
<p> They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze (woo)
<p> I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
<p> Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
<p> Highway to heaven, I'm just cruisin' by my lone'
<p> They cast me out, left me for dead, them people cold
<p> My faith in God, mind in the sun, I'm 'bout to sow (yeah)
<p> My life is hard, I took the wheel, I cracked the code (yeah-yeah, woah-oh-oh)
<p> Ain't nobody gon' save you, man, this life will break you (yeah, woah-oh-oh)
<p> In the thick of it, this is how the story goes
<p> I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
<p> They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
<p> I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
<p> Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
<p> I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows (everybody knows)
<p> They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze (yeah)
<p> I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
<p> Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told (ooh-ooh)
<p> Woah-oh-oh (nah-nah-nah-nah, ayy, ayy)
<p> This is how the story goes (nah, nah)
<p> Woah-oh-oh
<p> I guess this is how the story goes

<p> You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
<p> She's going off about something that you said
<p>'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
<p> I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
<p> I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
<p> And she'll never know your story like I do
<p> But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
<p> She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
<p> Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
<p> That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
<p> If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
<p> Been here all along, so why can't you see?
<p> You belong with me, you belong with me
<p> Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
<p> I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
<p> Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
<p>"Hey, isn't this easy?"
<p> And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
<p> I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
<p> You say you're fine, I know you better than that
<p> Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
<p> She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
<p> She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
<p> Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
<p> That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
<p> If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
<p> Been here all along, so why can't you see?
<p> You belong with me
<p> Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
<p> All this time how could you not know, baby?
<p> You belong with me, you belong with me
<p> Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
<p> I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
<p> I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
<p> Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me
<p> Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
<p> Been here all along, so why can't you see?
<p> You belong with me
<p> Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
<p> All this time how could you not know, baby?
<p> You belong with me, you belong with me
<p> You belong with me
<p> Have you ever thought, just maybe
<p> You belong with me?
<p> You belong with me
